                <p>Fourteen years before the famous Titanic ship wreck, a small town writer predicted the whole thing.<br><br>
                    In April 1912, The largest vessel ever to float at 800 feet long, 
                    displacing 45,000 tons, and declared unsinkable by all who had seen 
                    her was gliding through the water with roughly 2,500 peacefully sleeping passengers.
                </p>
                <img src="images/titan-1.JPG" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>Then, suddenly it struck an iceberg on its starboard side while moving at 25 knots.
                    The ship was 400 nautical miles from Newfoundland. The ship sank quickly, and due to 
                    an insufficient amount of lifeboats, it took a majority of its passengers with it.
                </p>
                <p>The Titan story sounds familiar to anyone with even minor knowledge of the wreck of Titanic. 
                    However, that story from the novel above isn’t a description of what happened to the Titanic.
                </p>
                <p>The actually the plot of the novel titled <b>Futility</b> which was released 14 years
                    before the Titanic ever set to sail.
                </p>
                <img src="images/images.jpg" width="600px" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>In 1898, a man named Morgan Robertson wrote a novel titled The Wreck 
                    of the Titan: Futility. The story was that of a man named John Rowland, an alcoholic 
                    and disgraced former Naval officer, who takes a job aboard the Titan, the worlds largest 
                    vessel. Robertson describes it as “unsinkable,” and “among the greatest works of men.” 
                    The Titan strikes an iceberg on its journey, sinking, and becoming one of the worlds greatest tragedies.<br>
                    The tale of Robertson could almost be an exact retelling of the Titanic tragedy, if not for its release date.
                </p>
                <p><b>The Similarities</b> between the Robertson: Wreck of the Titan  and the Titanic incident
                    go far beyond a name and an iceberg. The length of the titan was 800 feet, the Titanic 882. The speed at 
                    which the Titan cruised into the iceberg was 25 knots. The Titanic’s was 22.5. The Titan held 2,500 passengers. 
                    The Titanic held 2,200, though both had a capacity of 3,000.<br>
                    Both ships were British owned. Both ships were hit on their starboard bow, around midnight. Both sank in the 
                    North Atlantic exactly 400 nautical miles from Newfoundland. Both had a severe lack of lifeboats, 
                    the Titan holding 24, and Titanic carrying just 20. Both had a triple screw propeller.
                </p>
                <img src="images/titanics-2.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                <p>Though there are a few differences, they are few and far between. For example, the Titan’s sinking left only 13 survivors,
                    while the Titanic left 705, and the Titan actually capsized before sinking, where the Titanic split into two pieces.
                    The Titan’s hero John also slays a polar bear who lives on the iceberg in question, which the Titanic’s 
                    passengers probably didn’t have time for, but might have been an interesting addition to the movie.
                </p>
                <p>After the Titanic tragedy, Robertson was even accused of being clairvoyant due to the insane 
                    similarities between his work and real life. After all, the likelihood of someone writing a 
                    book so similar to a tragedy that hadn’t even taken place yet is almost impossible.<br>
                    However, he attributed the similarities to his extensive knowledge of shipbuilding, 
                    and research of maritime trends, which, when looked at, do something to explain the eerie commonalities.
